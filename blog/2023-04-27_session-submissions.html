    <h1 class="title is-1">2023 Session Submission &amp; Selection</h1>
    <p>The 2023 Session Submission & Selection for our conference was a great success, with a total of 162 session submissions received. Unfortunately, due to the limitations of the venue, we could only accommodate 35 sessions. In this blog post, we will discuss the breakdown of the submitted sessions, speaker demographics, and the sessions that were selected.</p>
    <h2 class="title is-2">Session Submissions</h2>
    <p>Last year, when we returned to Atlanta, we received 99 session submissions, and we were able to select 30 sessions. This year, we saw a remarkable 163% increase in submissions, with 162 sessions submitted, which is the most we have ever received. The majority of the sessions were submitted to our Administrator and Developer tracks, and we observed a distinct uptick in session submissions just before the submission window closed.</p>

    <h2 class="title is-2">Session Selection</h2>
    <p>When it came to session selection, we chose more sessions (by percentage) for the executive, business analysis, marketing, end-user, and non-profit tracks. If you are considering submitting a session next year, we suggest branching out and submitting extra talks into a smaller pool of sessions to increase your chances of being selected.</p>

    <h2 class="title is-2">Diversity and Inclusion</h2>
    <p>We made a conscious effort to ensure diversity and inclusion in our speaker selection process. We wanted to choose speakers who represented our vibrant community so that everyone attending the conference could feel represented. To that end, we also collected data on the demographics of the speakers we invited to speak at Southeast Dreamin' in 2023. This information will help us identify underrepresented spaces and work to raise them up using our platform. We noticed that we need to increase our engagement with the Transgender, Agender, Indigenous, Native, or Aboriginal communities since we did not receive any submissions from them. We want to remove any barriers for them and encourage them to submit sessions in the future.</p>
