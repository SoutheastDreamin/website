After the sessions have been selected, we will review the session speakers to try to ensure that we give community members the most opportunities to present.</p><p>To learn more about session selection, feel free to review the blog post from the <a href="https://southeastdreamin.com/blog/2022/11/21/session-selection/">2023 conference</a> that includes a video presentation.
