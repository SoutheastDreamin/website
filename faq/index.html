The members will then assign a score from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest, to each session.  These votes will then be averaged together and applied to the session information.  The session selection team will then pick from the highest rated sessions to build a rounded schedule that provides enough sessions for each track.  After the sessions have been selected, we will review the session speakers to try to ensure that we give community members the most opportunities to present.</dd>

                <dt class="title is-5 mt-4 mb-1">How are hands-on trainings selected?</dt>
                <dd>Because of the time commitment and the high technical requirements for presenting hands-on training, selections  of submitted hands-on training are not done blindly. The session selection team will review all submitted trainings and select topics that meet our community’s needs as well as being taught by a skilled presenter.  If we see similar trainings being proposed by multiple people, we may approach these community members to see if they are willing to work together to provide a single training session.</dd>
