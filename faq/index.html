                <dt class="title is-5 mt-4 mb-1">How are sessions selected?</dt>
                <dd>After March 31st 2022 a group of Southeast Dreamin’ team members will be sent an anonymized list of session titles, abstracts and session tracks.  The members will then assign a score from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest, to each session.  These votes will then be averaged together and applied to the session information.  The session selection team will then pick from the highest rated sessions to build a rounded schedule that provides enough sessions for each track.  After the sessions have been selected, we will review the session speakers to try to ensure that we give community members the most opportunities to present.</dd>
                
                <dt class="title is-5 mt-4 mb-1">When will sessions be announced?</dt>
                <dd>Sessions will be posted to the schedule page after April 7th 2022 and after all speakers have been confirmed.</dd>

                <dd>On (or before) April 7th 2022 an email will be sent to every community member who submitted a session announcing the status of the submission.  If you are selected, we will verify your availability and finalize the schedule.  If you are not selected, we may reach out to you after the notification date if one of our selected speakers becomes unavailable.</dd>
                
                <dt class="title is-5 mt-4 mb-1">How are hands-on trainings selected?</dt>
                <dd>Because of the time commitment and the high technical requirements for presenting hands-on training, selections  of submitted hands-on training are not done blindly. The session selection team will review all submitted trainings and select topics that meet our community’s needs as well as being taught by a skilled presenter.  If we see similar trainings being proposed by multiple people, we may approach these community members to see if they are willing to work together to provide a single training session.</dd>

                <dt class="title is-5 mt-4 mb-1">What's the best way to get to the hotel from the airport?</dt>
                <dd>You can take a taxi or rideshare to the hotel from the airport however, traffic in the Atlanta area is notoriously bad and can be significantly longer than the advertised 40 minute drive. There is a MARTA stop located within walking distance from the hotel that should take approximately 35 minutes to take.  Simply take the gold line from the airport to Lenox station.  Exit the station and travel 0.2mi north along Lenox Rd NE to the hotel.</dd>
