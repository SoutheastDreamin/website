The transition to flow is demonstrated through the familiar process builder layout, allowing those newer to the tool to have the confidence they can use their existing skills to champion flow.</p><p>The session will establish rules for creating a flow framework that works in large, complex environments beginning with naming conventions that are standardized to provide easy Flow List View creation, mirror development terms (Trigger, Classes), and allow for easy componentization and reusability of flows.  The focus shifts to how the 'one process per object' rule works with Flow Triggers; setting guidelines for how to keep control of your order of execution while managing increasingly complex automation needs.</p><p>The design pattern itself demonstrates how Flow Triggers, Flow 'Trigger Handles', and Flow 'Classes' work together to create an all encompassing approach to flow that is highly flexible, modular, and scalable.

To enable multiple teams working on numerous large projects, we've become adept at dark deployment strategies, as well as managing different, complex sandbox pipelines, including multiple QA environments merging to a single UAT environment. In this presentation we will go over dark deployment strategies, such as using 'natural' barriers / switches such as Record Type, permission sets, or other differentiators for a feature, as well as using custom metadata or labels. We use dark deployment strategies to separate the release of code from feature go-live, enabling roll back to original functionality through a change of a label, or enabling the gradual roll out of new features to subsets of users.</p><p>We've dealt with some unique DevOps challenges due to the complexity and size of our Salesforce organization. To adapt we've been through some growing pains in how to do DevOps correctly, including bringing Devs and Admins on board to better practices and dark deployments. Hopefully by sharing some of our learned best practices, other organizations can have better DevOps implementations.</p>",
