If we see similar trainings being proposed by multiple people, we may approach these community members to see if they are willing to work together to provide a single training session."

There is a MARTA stop located within walking distance from the hotel that should take approximately 20 minutes to take. Simply take the red or gold line from the airport to the North Avenue station. Exit the station and travel 0.5mi north along West Peachtree Street to the hotel."
