            <h1>Sponsor FAQ</h1>
            <h2>What are the dates of the conference?</h2>

            <p>Southeast Dreamin’ will take place starting at 10 am ET Thursday, {{ globals.event_day_one }} thru 5pm ET Friday, {{ globals.event_day_two }}.</p>

            <h2>What sponsorship opportunities are available?</h2>
            <p>You can review our sponsorship prospectus by filling out the Interest Form. There are a limited number of sponsorships available. Sponsorship agreements must be signed by Friday, {{ globals.sponsor_date_agreement }}. Payment for all sponsorships must be paid by Wednesday, {{ globals.sponsor_date_payment }} to receive the full benefits.</p>

            <h2>What happens during the sponsorship process?</h2>
            <p>During the sponsorship process the Southeast Dreamin’ team will work with your team to answer any questions and determine the best sponsorship option that works best for your organization. When you are ready to move forward, please notify the Southeast team who should receive the agreement to sign and if there are any individuals that should be cc’ed on the agreement. The agreement will be emailed via PandaDocs and will automatically expire after 60 days.</p>
            <p>When the agreement is signed, your sponsorship is officially confirmed and the Southeast Dreamin’ team will immediately begin your onboarding to ensure the best conference experience. You will be provided a set of dates of when you’ll need to submit information and confirmations to the team to deliver benefits. Priority is provided for limited sponsorship benefits in order of payment received.</p>
            <p>Sponsors should expect response times of 1 - 3 business days from the Southeast Dreamin’ team via email. The conference planning team are all volunteers and cannot guarantee same day response times.</p>

            <h2>How is payment processed?</h2>
            <p>After a sponsorship agreement is signed, an invoice will be sent in which payment either via ACH or credit card must be received within 30 days. If needed, a Bank Verification letter can be provided in order to pay directly and outside of the invoice.</p>
            <p>A late fee of 5% per day will automatically be applied if an invoice is not paid within a 7 business day grace period. Returning sponsors from the previous year will be given 45 days to pay an invoice and a 14 day grace period.</p>

            <h2>Can a sponsorship be canceled?</h2>
            <p>Yes, a sponsorship can be canceled with written notice sent to <a href="sponsors@dreaminevents.com">sponsors@dreaminevents.com</a> with the subject line Company Name Sponsorship Cancellation prior to {{ globals.sponsor_date_cancel_half }}. Cancellations will not be honored if communicated outside of that method.</p>
            <p>A refund of 75% of the sponsorship fee will be given if canceled prior to 11:59 pm ET {{ globals.sponsor_date_cancel_three_quarter }}, 50% if canceled prior to 11:59 pm ET {{ globals.sponsor_date_cancel_half }}, and no refund will be given after {{ globals.sponsor_date_cancel_final }}.</p>

            <h2>Can materials be shipped to the hotel?</h2>
            <p>Yes, materials can be shipped but cannot arrive prior to Sunday, {{ globals.sponsor_date_ship }}. There is a fee of $5 per box that will be charged to the sponsor. There is limited space at the hotel so please be considerate of the number of items shipped. Please ensure all boxes are addressed as follows:</p>

            <h2>What happens if a submission deadline is missed?</h2>
            <p>Life happens - the Southeast Dreamin’ team understands that sometimes deadlines are missed. If you submit the information within 5 business days after the deadline, the team will do its best to still deliver the sponsorship benefits. Do note, if the due dates are within June {{ globals.event_year }}, the team cannot guarantee that the full benefit will be delivered even with the 5 day grace period.</p>
