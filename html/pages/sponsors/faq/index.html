            <h2>What happens during the sponsorship process?</h2>
            <p>During the sponsorship process the Southeast Dreamin’ team will work with your team to answer any questions and determine the best sponsorship option that works best for your organization. When you are ready to move forward, please notify the Southeast team who should receive the agreement to sign and if there are any individuals that should be cc’ed on the agreement. The agreement will be emailed via PandaDocs and will automatically expire after 60 days.</p>
            <p>When the agreement is signed, your sponsorship is officially confirmed and the Southeast Dreamin’ team will immediately begin your onboarding to ensure the best conference experience. You will be provided a set of dates of when you’ll need to submit information and confirmations to the team to deliver benefits. Priority is provided for limited sponsorship benefits in order of payment received.</p>
            <p>Sponsors should expect response times of 1 - 3 business days from the Southeast Dreamin’ team via email. The conference planning team are all volunteers and cannot guarantee same day response times.</p>

            <h2>How is payment processed?</h2>
            <p>After a sponsorship agreement is signed, an invoice will be sent in which payment either via ACH or credit card must be received within 30 days. If needed, a Bank Verification letter can be provided in order to pay directly and outside of the invoice.</p>
            <p>A late fee of 5% per day will automatically be applied if an invoice is not paid within a 7 business day grace period. Returning sponsors from the previous year will be given 45 days to pay an invoice and a 14 day grace period.</p>

            <h2>What happens if a submission deadline is missed?</h2>

If you submit the information within 5 business days after the deadline, the team will do its best to still deliver the sponsorship benefits. Do note, if the due dates are within June 2024, the team cannot guarantee that the full benefit will be delivered even with the 5 day grace period.</p>
