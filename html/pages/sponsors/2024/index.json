This potentially hierarchical list of users can be easily configured and changed frequently and avoids relying on highly complex approval processes or Role Hierarchy in order to determine who the approvers are (both of which are highly problematic).</li></ol><p>Our suite of Best Practice enablers for the Salesforce Platform including support for any/all applications on the Salesforce platform (e.g. Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Data Cloud, Platform Cloud, custom Apps, etc.).
