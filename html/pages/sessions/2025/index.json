      "abstract": "<p>The goal of this session is to illustrate how to create dynamic solutions using custom configuration objects. </p><p>Custom configuration objects allow trusted users to create and maintain dynamic information in Salesforce without altering application meta data. By moving configurations from admin/developer teams to trusted users it allows for quick and flexible changes to Salesforce without admin/developer teams being involved.</p><p>Configuration objects are custom objects that are used to store settings, options, or other dynamic variables used in the Salesforce organization. Examples of configuration objects use cases are default tasks and events for clients, release notes, custom error messaging, products, product options, fees and discounts, and many more.</p><p>Unlike custom settings, users can access these through custom applications or tabs, then report on these objects and their relations. Custom objects allow for an unlimited number of records and a larger variety of custom field types.</p><p>In this session, we will demonstrate how custom configuration objects are used to create and maintain a product catalog that includes user defined products, product options, product fees, and product discounts.  As the product’s variables change over the lifecycle of the product, the trusted user can define new product options, add or expire discounts and fees, and create new products.  These products can be offered based on specific client parameters that could include client size, partner relationships or other custom configurations.</p><p>An additional use case in this demo is how custom configuration objects are utilized in the creation of templated contract agreements  defined and maintained by the finance and sales departments.  These templates allow the application of pre-negotiated fees, commissions, and performance guarantees  based on specific negotiations with marketing partners.  These templates are created and maintained by the members of the finance team and applied to prospect or renewal opportunities as certain opportunity stages are reached.  The templates are driven by multiple variables in the opportunity that include the specified marketing partner, the overall size of the opportunity, and the total number of closed won opportunities associated with that marketing partner over a specified time.</p><p>Templated contract agreements allow users to ensure the correct fees and commissions are incorporated into the opportunity early in the sales cycle.  This ensures that the correct amounts are calculated into the overall deal and allows the business to avoid retroactively applying any additional fees or discounts outside of our standard amounts.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>Do you have a ton of requests all competing for attention from multiple stakeholders across the business with no clear process for prioritizing them? In a world increasingly focused on revenue generation and cost savings are you able to quantify in dollars the value that your Salesforce team brings to the organization? These two questions might seem unrelated but they can both be solved with one underlying strategy- tracking and reporting on automation enhancements provided by your Salesforce team.</p><p>Work with end users and stakeholders to identify and document whether or not a request is an automation enhancement and capture few key details about the current state process including: how long the process takes, how often it recurs, and how many people are responsible for completing the process. This enables you to calculate how much time users spend in a specific process on an annual basis and then how much time is saved after the automation request is complete. The data gathered helps give a clear basis for prioritizing requests based on impact by highlighting which processes take up the most time to complete manually and what the cost-benefit is of automating them.</p><p>But wait- there’s more! Once automation enhancements are complete those time savings can be represented as cost savings by taking blended hourly rates for a full-time employee (or any other relevant metric) and converting that time into money. It becomes easy to see the value that is created as a result of eliminating repetitive or inefficient tasks so that people are enabled to spend more time focusing more on the things that matter the most.</p><p>This session will walk through some examples of what an automation request is, how to capture useful information about the automation requests, how to use extended reporting to extrapolate those time savings into hours saved annually, and then how those time savings can be represented as cost savings to prioritize requests and show the impact of your Salesforce team’s work to executive leadership and stakeholders.</p>",
