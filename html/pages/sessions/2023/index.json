With the developer console you can direct queries without having to login to Workbench and edit data without having to visit the record page.  Have a slow running report and want to figure out why?  The developer console has you covered!  We'll even dip our toes into the world of logging and deployments that can help you report issues to vendors or your internal development teams more efficiently.  So let's uncover the possibilities that await inside the developer console!</p>",

As Salesforce developers, we spend most of our time squarely placed in the \"pro-code\" realm. While a solution might require code, we can still enable our low-code and no-code colleagues by designing our solutions giving them levers to control our code's behavior via clicks. This presentation will focus on using tools such as custom metadata, custom settings, and custom objects to expose your code to configuration. Examples as well as recommended best practices will be discussed to provide guidelines and techniques. As a result, developers will be equipped with tools to enable their low-code/no-code colleagues, admins will be equipped with a framework for requesting configurable code from developers, and architects will be equipped with patterns for implementing configurable pro-code development.</p>",
